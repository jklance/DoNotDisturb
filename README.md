dnd.html
---------------
A standalone timer client for displaying locally only. It is completely 
self-contained, so the one file can be used without any of the rest.

Server-based client. Will display the remaining time on the server-timer 
(if any).

admin.php
---------------
Server-based admin for the client. Will display the remaining time, as 
well as allow for starting and restarting the timer.

clearTimer.php 
---------------
Ajax endpoint to zero-out the server time.

resetTimer.php
---------------
Ajax endpoint to set the server time back to the starting value.
